    "### Answer:\n",
    "Database is an organized or systematic collection of data or types of data store based on the use of database management system. \n",
    "The major differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases are as follows:\n",
    "1. SQL database are relational based but NoSQL database are non-relational.\n",
    "2. SQL stand for structured query language and have predefined schema but NoSQL stand for Not\n",
    "only structured query language and have dynamic schema.\n",
    "3. A unique primary key can only be assign to SQL but in case of NoSQL document id can be defined with unique numbers."
